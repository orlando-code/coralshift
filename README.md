Coral reefs are biodiversity hotspots that play a pivotal role in the health of global marine ecosystems, as well as protecting coastlines and sustaining coastal communities throughout the tropics. Coral reefs are under intense and increasing stress from global climate change and poor land management practices, giving rise to temperature increases, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and coastal pollution. Together, these stressors pose an existential risk to coral reefs, which are threatened with functional extinction in many parts of the world over the coming decades.

There has been considerable innovation and progress in coral reef conservation, but protecting coral reefs in the long term requires acknowledging and working within the context of global climate change. The geographic distribution of regions able to support coral reefs will shift under climate change, and significant areas of current reef will not survive. It is therefore essential to focus conservation efforts on regions where reefs might survive in future, and on regions that may become suitable in the coming decades. To guide this conservation effort, we need tools that can robustly predict the presence and health of coral reefs from the relatively coarse-scale data available in climate models.

This three-month research project will aim to answer the how, when, and why this migration will occur by creating a predictive model of reef presence using oceanographic, land use, and coastal topographic data.
