# Thanks for your interest in contributing!

This project contributes towards my current Master of Research degree, as part of my 1+3 course with the [AI4ER CDT](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/). As such, there isn't an opportunity to contribute directly. However, it is likely that my future PhD will be in an highly-related area.

If this research interests you – if you have any questions, suggestions, or comments – please do get in touch! My website and contacts can be accessed [here](https://orlando-code.github.io/). I am always happy to learn from others, or hear about potential future collaborations.

**Happy reading!**
